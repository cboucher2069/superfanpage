	<h1>Apex Legends</h1>
	<p>Apex Legends in a Battle Royale video game in which the goal is that of any Battle Royale game, to be the last person or team standing. The main part of this game that separates it from the other battle royales are the characters. There are 20 different characters you can play as, and thus play against. They all have unique abilities for different playstyles creating a new experience every game. </p>

	<p><em>"I cannot wait to win this match, friend!", one of the many unique voice lines that give the characters a personality. This quote coming from Pathfinder, a friendly and cheerful robot.</em></p></blockquote>
	<h1>Respawn Entertainment</h1>
	<p>Respawn Entertainment is the company that made Apex Legends, along with other video games in the same universe. Respawn made the game series Titanfall, which exists in the same universe as Apex Legends. Everybody is a big fan of how good the movement is in Titanfall, so getting the same movement in Apex Legends was a huge win.</p>

	<h1>Game Play</h1>
	<p>There are unique aspets other than the characters that make this game unique, so let us shed some light on those aswell.</p>
	<h2>Maps</h2>
	<p> There are three different maps that you can get into a game on :
	<ul>
	<li>Kings Canyon</li>
	<li>Olympus</li>
	<li>Storm Point</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	Each of these maps have different Points of Interest, or POI's, that you can land at. Your game experience will depend on where you land, such as landing somewhere with high loot but many players or worse loot but less players.</p>
	<h2>Cosmetics</h2>
	<p>The Cosmetics you can get in this game allow you to customize your character to represent you and make it unique. The way to unlock Cosmetics in Apex is to open Apex Packs. Apex Packs are like chests in other games, in which upon opening them you get three items of select rarities. You can either buy Apex Packs with real money or earn them through playing the game. There are 5 different item rarities you can obtain through a pack.</p>
